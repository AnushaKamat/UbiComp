Built my first Android app that uses the built-in sensors for something useful. 
This app will count the number of steps that you have taken and show that number on the screen. 
I have used the raw data from the accelerometer and gyroscope to complete this task. 
The data will require some very simple signal processing and used combination of threshold crossing and pattern recognition using peak detection when a step is taken.
I have also assumed the user only holds the phone in a fixed posture in their hands.
