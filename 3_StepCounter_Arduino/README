Here  I made a step counter using Adafruit Circuit Playground with Arduino IDE

The step counting algorithm remains same as that I used for Android.

- I have mainly considered values of x- axis as they were contributing the most towards walking/running
-The algorithm for signal processing is as below:
1. A sliding window of 15 samples is considered.
2. Raw accelerometer data is subtracted by the previous accelerometer data .Hence , performing a 1 bit differentiation
3. The differentiated data is put in the sliding window
3. Maximum of the sliding windows is taken to detect the peak 
The peaks are checked if crossing a certain threshold
A time debounce is included to eliminate false positives which occur as harmonics of major peeak leading to 1 step. 
A simple analytical data that 1 step takes around 0.3 s is been used for time debounce

Handling the Board: As the accelerometer data s sensitive, the board is been handled in parallel to the floor setting
